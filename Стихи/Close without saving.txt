Close without saving,
Run about a mile,
Come in, sit down by the fire.
It's been a while.

Smile without knowing,
Listen about the highlands,
Fall asleep in the mirror,
Follow the silence.

Down a narrow river
Flags at the lake are waving:
Wide awake in the mirror
I'm close without saving.

P.S.

Goes without saying,
Round about, tangled,
Ways of knowing fail,
Fall through the mirror, failing.
