The colonist's death

- Boy, give me that gun from the wall.
I need it right now.
Thanks, leave me alone with myself,
you're free for an hour.

- Jane, thank you for everything that
was given to me.
"I'm going to shoot it all back,
gonna be free."

- God, what you expect me to do?
What to explain?
"Everything that I am to
is gonna be pain."

"Evening. I'm just getting soft.
But using the gun
now I'm going off
the Indian sun."
