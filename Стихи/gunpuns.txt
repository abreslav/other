Pull the trigger up the hill 
And be ok you never will
You never will

Draw the gun in purple ink
And be ok you do not blink
You never will

Empty shells fall on the floor
Thereâ€™s no pearls for evermore 
You paid the bill 

In a spare magazine 
On every page the words are mean
You never heal

You never feel
You look surreal
You never heal
You paid the bill
We had a deal
You rusty steel
