What do you answer to the voices in your head?
What do you dread?
Whom do you see when you look back to what you've done?
Don't stop, come on.

Come on, for shiny speckles in the sky,
them passing by,
for all you traded for another glance of that,
for everyone you never ever met,
for me, for those who didn't care much,
for silly touch,

for little struggling gasp of icy air,
for what you dare,

for what you dare not, 
for coming back,
for looking through the spectacles of age,
for blind rage,
that silly little touch,

is not too much.

Those voices in your head forget me not,
what have you got?
You turned away from what you had ahead,
what do you dread?

What haunts you in the empty streets of here,
whom do you fear?
Whoever they might be they're long since gone.
Don't stop, come on.
