Believe or not, be patient, sit and listen:
I hereby declare people wrong,
declare their urge, against the nature,
against the very fact, to set apart

themselves from everybody else, who might be
that very one, whom, lost amidst the dark,
they seek around, feeling, feeble-fingered,
along the seals of their wooden shells.

Along the time that always seems to fail,
that needs a kind hand to mend and tweak
the wheels, and springs and falls and rises up,
against your will it rudely draws your forward.
Remain what you have been, and every night,
when wicked dreams attack your tired eye-lids,
I'll scratch against the planks, and you will wake,

you'll call my name and I shall yell and cry,
all hissing breath and gasps and desperation,
and hit and scratch against my empty shell,
and beg to let me in, despite the calling.
